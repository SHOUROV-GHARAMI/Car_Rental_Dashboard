ðŸ“˜Car Rental Dashboard (React + Tailwind)
 ðŸŽ¨ Design Reference: (Car Rent Dashboard UI) https://www.figma.com/design/ohC3iZIhRQeY0PxSPOFY1D/Car-Rental-Company-Dashboard-UI--Community-?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=kKxKBtrcJcEtdCyK-0

Reusable components


Static mock data


ðŸ§© Features & Sections
ðŸŸ¦ 1. Sidebar

ðŸŸ¨ 2. Top Bar
Search bar on the top right


Notification icon


ðŸŸ© 3. Stats Section (Left side cards)

Use static numbers from the screenshot. Data can be an object/array.

ðŸŸ§ 4. Car Availability Box
Input field for car number


Date picker (static input)


Time selector (static input)


"Check" button


These inputs donâ€™t need to be functional; just focus on UI.

Show 3 rows with static mock data:


Alex Noman (Completed)
